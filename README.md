FUD is an acronym for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. FUD is a common tactic in the cryptocurrency world to manipulate the price that a cryptocurrency is trading at. 

My response:

The crux of this FUD is ignoring the value that Smart Contracts bring to the table for businesses. Like most FUD, it paints a plausible picture while ignoring one or more key facts. This ignores that ChainLink creates trustlessness not just for a company and its API calls, but for two parties entering an agreement that transacts based on data. As for ChainLink only being a crypto world application - that is obviously not the case. It is being developed as a versatile middleware - it isnâ€™t platform or currency dependant. It was designed with legacy systems and big business in mind, making the barriers to entry as small as possible. Obviously nothing is guaranteed, but ChainLink has the best shot of anything out there to be the bridge for businesses to unlock the potential of Blockchain & Smart Contracts.

It's hard but necessary to remember that we (token speculators) are not ChainLink's target market. The main users of ChainLink will most likely be businesses, making their marketing and networking efforts in the business sphere. As others have suggested if you need to see that things are moving along check out their Github page or Pivotal tracker. Even if you can't read the code you can see how often things are being updated and when milestones are being reached.

Someone replies to me:
Why did they make the token public then? Why did they have an ICO etc? Genuinely curious

My response:
Being funded by a single entity would have been very problematic for the project. A wide distribution of tokens greatly benefits ChainLink and incentivizes more people to operate nodes for return on their investment. The more decentralized the nodes are the better and without a token sale it's hard to imagine how this might have been accomplished.
They have no current incentive to try to inflate the price through social media or other means. Boosting the price of LINK - temporarily or otherwise - doesn't increase adoption of the network. Their goal is to release ChainLink, and they seem to be making great progress.
